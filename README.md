## Files
  1) AdaBoost.py    - the main python script. Opens data, plots it, generates
                      weak classifiers, and performs AdaBoost. It finally uses
		      the boosted models from AdaBoost to perform a one vs all 
		      multiclass classification on the dataset
  2) data/...       - the datafiles
  3) DataImport.py  - python code that reads in datafiles
  4) README.md      - this file
  5) WeakModeler.py - python code that generates a Weak Classifier Model
                     (lambda) for a given set of labeled data
